A scanning interferometer diagnostic has been used to analyze the time evolution of the RE beam radial position and its instabilities. Correspondence of the interferometer time traces, radial profile reconstructed via magnetic measurements and fission chamber signals are discussed. New RE control algorithms, which define in real-time updated plasma current and position references, have been tested in two experimental scenarios featuring disruption generated RE plateaus. Comparative studies among 52 discharges with disruption generated RE beam plateaus are presented in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies as the RE beam interaction with the plasma facing components is reduced while the current is ramped-down.},

Another actuator, the V poloidal coil, is available for horizontal position regulation but its bandwidth is insufficient to suitably perform the horizontal position regulation task.

  abstract       = {Experimental results on the position and current control of disruption generated runaway electrons (RE) in FTU are presented. A scanning interferometer diagnostic has been used to analyze the time evolution of the RE beam radial position and its instabilities. Correspondence of the interferometer time traces, radial profile reconstructed via magnetic measurements and fission chamber signals are discussed. New RE control algorithms, which define in real-time updated plasma current and position references, have been tested in two experimental scenarios featuring disruption generated RE plateaus. Comparative studies among 52 discharges with disruption generated RE beam plateaus are presented in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies as the RE beam interaction with the plasma facing components is reduced while the current is ramped-down.},

	abstract = {A scanning beam interferometer installed on the Frascati tokamak upgrade (FTU) experiment is presented. The scanning beam scheme combined with the small dimensions of the beams produces a system with very high spatial resolution: more than 30 adjacent(nonoverlapping) chords sample most of the plasma cross section.A good time resolution is achieved by the use of a proper scanning device, with a scanning frequency$\geq$8 kHz. Very fast events are measured by three additional fixed lines of sight providing a time resolution$\geq$100 kHz. The instrument is a two-color medium-infrared-compensated-type interferometer; two wavelengths (colors)are used to measure both the density and the mechanical vibrations of optical components. ACO2 laser($\lambda$$=$10.6 $\mu$m) is the main light source,and a CO laser($\lambda$$=$5.4 $\mu$m) is the compensation one. The optical scheme is a double pass Mach-Zehnder type. All the retroreflector mirrors are mounted directly on the FTU mechanical structure thanks to the compensation system that allows for large vibration amplitudes of optical components. Heterodyne detection at 30 and40 MHz is obtained by frequency shifting the reference beams with two acousto-optic modulators (Bragg cells). Many features are implemented to achieve high measurement accuracy and reliability.A real-time system computes the integral density measured on one of the fixed lines of sight and provides an analog signal for density feedback control. The interferometer was used to measure density profiles both in medium-density discharges(ne$\approx$1020 m{\textminus}3)and in high-density pellet injected discharges(ne$\approx$7-8{\texttimes}1020 m{\textminus}3).The measurement error is$\approx$2{\texttimes}1018 m{\textminus}2 under optimal conditions but can be higher in some cases, mainly because of the large tilt of the retroreflector mirrors.},

	abstract = "Improved understanding of runaway-electron formation and decay processes are of prime interest for the safe operation of large tokamaks, and the dynamics of the runaway electrons during dynamical scenarios such as disruptions are of particular concern. In this paper, we present kinetic modelling of scenarios with time-dependent plasma parameters; in particular, we investigate hot-tail runaway generation during a rapid drop in plasma temperature. With the goal of studying runaway-electron generation with a self-consistent electric-field evolution, we also discuss the implementation of a collision operator that conserves momentum and energy and demonstrate its properties. An operator for avalanche runaway-electron generation, which takes the energy dependence of the scattering cross section and the runaway distribution into account, is investigated. We show that the simplified avalanche model of Rosenbluth and Putvinskii (1997 Nucl. Fusion 37 1355) can give inaccurate results for the avalanche growth rate (either lower or higher) for many parameters, especially when the average runaway energy is modest, such as during the initial phase of the avalanche multiplication. The developments presented pave the way for improved modelling of runaway-electron dynamics during disruptions or other dynamic events.",

	abstract={A stability principle is derived and applied to simple tokamak configurations in order to study feedback stabilization of unstable, vertically elongated tokamak plasmas. For practical applicability it is assumed that the fast instabilities are slowed down by passive conductors so that only slow motions have to be considered. Numerical results are presented for a surface current model of plasma with one conjugate pair of axisymmetric feedback loops. Stabilization is possible, except in a limited region of loop positions. The optimum loop position in the region with possible stabilization is determined.}

	abstract={We present an overview of FTU experiments on runaway electron (RE) generation and control carried out through a comprehensive set of real-time (RT) diagnostics/control systems and newly installed RE diagnostics. An RE imaging spectrometer system detects visible and infrared synchrotron radiation. A Cherenkov probe measures RE escaping the plasma. A gamma camera provides hard x-ray radial profiles from RE bremsstrahlung interactions in the plasma. Experiments on the onset and suppression of RE show that the threshold electric field for RE generation is larger than that expected according to a purely collisional theory, but consistent with an increase due to synchrotron radiation losses. This might imply a lower density to be targeted with massive gas injection for RE suppression in ITER. Experiments on active control of disruption-generated RE have been performed through feedback on poloidal coils by implementing an RT boundary-reconstruction algorithm evaluated on magnetic moments. The results indicate that the slow plasma current ramp-down and the simultaneous reduction of the reference plasma external radius are beneficial in dissipating the RE beam energy and population, leading to reduced RE interactions with plasma facing components. RE active control is therefore suggested as a possible alternative or complementary technique to massive gas injection.}

	abstract={The potential for damage, the magnitude of the extrapolation, and the importance of the atypical—incidents that occur once in a thousand shots—make theory and simulation essential for ensuring that relativistic runaway electrons will not prevent ITER from achieving its mission. Most of the theoretical literature on electron runaway assumes magnetic surfaces exist. ITER planning for the avoidance of halo and runaway currents is focused on massive-gas or shattered-pellet injection of impurities. In simulations of experiments, such injections lead to a rapid large-scale magnetic-surface breakup. Surface breakup, which is a magnetic reconnection, can occur on a quasi-ideal Alfvénic time scale when the resistance is sufficiently small. Nevertheless, the removal of the bulk of the poloidal flux, as in halo-current mitigation, is on a resistive time scale. The acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies requires the confinement of some tubes of magnetic flux within the plasma and a resistive time scale. The interpretation of experiments on existing tokamaks and their extrapolation to ITER should carefully distinguish confined versus unconfined magnetic field lines and quasi-ideal versus resistive evolution. The separation of quasi-ideal from resistive evolution is extremely challenging numerically, but is greatly simplified by constraints of Maxwell’s equations, and in particular those associated with magnetic helicity. The physics of electron runaway along confined magnetic field lines is clarified by relations among the poloidal flux change required for an e-fold in the number of electrons, the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons, and the number of relativistic electron strikes that can be expected in a single disruption event.}
